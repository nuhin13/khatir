"""Accounts service layer (business logic; no logic in views — T-003/T-005 §2).

Re-exports the OTP lifecycle primitives (T-003) so callers import account
services from one place, and adds the two auth use-cases consumed by the
endpoints in T-005:

* :func:`request_otp` — cooldown check → generate (T-003) → dispatch (T-004).
* :func:`verify_otp_and_get_user` — verify (T-003) → get-or-create the ``User``.

Views stay thin: they validate input, call one of these, serialize the result.
Failures are raised as typed exceptions from ``core.exceptions`` so the handler
maps them to the standard error envelope. JWT issuance is **not** done here — it
is T-006; verify returns the ``User`` for T-006 to mint tokens from.
